# most of the design is done only optimusation and implimenting more cost cuting measures are remaining 
# personal stuff about the keeb
when i make this, this will be my second ever mechanical keyboard <br>
so naturally i am confused about the switches, i recently ordered a switch tester for kailh and gateron (after some research landed on kailh as i think it’s a good balance between price and quality imo <br>
since the inception of the project i was keen on the box jade, so i was sure to buy a tester pack including it , and from the beginning i thought linear switches were mushy and not good so i never considered them but, the tester also has 2 linear switches gateron box ink pink and box black <br>
and hoelay moelay i love the ink pink, don’t get me wrong box jade is also really nice but the ink pink feels so smooth and premium <br>
and now i can’t choose between them :(
